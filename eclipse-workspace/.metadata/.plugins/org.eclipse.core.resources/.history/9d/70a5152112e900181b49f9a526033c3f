         PROBLEM 4
         When one number divides another without leaving a remainder the first number is called a factor of the second. 
         A number n is said to be perfect if the sum of the factors which are less than n are equal to n. 
         For example, 28 is a perfect number because the sum of its factors which are less 
         than 28 (1, 2, 4, 7, and 14) equals 28.
          
         Using a 'for' loop, write code to identify if the value in 'g' is perfect.
         FOR STUDY
         Using a 'for' loop, write code to identify if the value in 'h' is perfect.
         Using a 'for' loop, write code to identify if the value in 'z' is perfect.
